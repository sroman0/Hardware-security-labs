# Random Number Generators

## Linear Congruential generator implementation in C

A linear congruential generator (LCG) is an algorithm that yields a sequence of pseudo-randomized
numbers calculated with a discontinuous piecewise linear equation. It is the most common method for
generating random numbers present in languages like C, C++, Java, etc. The LCG is defined by the
recurrence relation:

$X_{n+1}$ = $(aX_n + c)$ mod $m$

where:

- $X_n$ is the sequence of pseudo-random values
- $a$ is the multiplier
- $c$ is the increment
- $m$ is the modulus

### Implementation

Implement the LCG in C using the following parameters, and changing the m value.
- Use the `lcg.h` file to implement your function

- $a$ = 75
- $c$ = 74
- $m$ = show values in the table below
- $X_0$ = 1

Fill the table with the first 5 numbers generated by the LCG.

| **LCG** | **X** | **X+1** | **X+2** | **X+3** | **X+4** | **X+5** |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| m = 2   | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 3   | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 5   | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 7   | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 11  | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 12  | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 13  | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
| m = 17  | 1     |         |         |         |         |         |
