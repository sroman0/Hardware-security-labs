## Course Overview

The *"Hardware and Embedded Security"* course focuses on the principles and practices of securing hardware systems. The primary goal is to understand vulnerabilities in hardware and learn techniques to protect embedded systems from various attacks.

### âœ… Key Learning Objectives:
- Develop proficiency in **Verilog** and **C** for hardware security applications.
- Understand and implement **side-channel analysis** and **fault attacks**.
- Explore **secure boot mechanisms** and **cryptographic hardware**.
- Analyze and mitigate security risks in **embedded systems**.
